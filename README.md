# OpenCLCourse

Introduction to GPU programming using OpenCL and OpenMP.

## Tasks

### Matrix multiplication

Implement several ways to multiplicate matrices with optimizations. Multiplication should be parallelized on the GPU device using OpenCL framework. Write random and manual tests for the solution. 

### Prefix sum 

Implement prefix sum of array. Computations should be parallelized on the GPU device using OpenCL framework. Write random and manual tests for the solution.
